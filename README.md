## Scope
The purpose of this project is to use deep learning to build image classification models that can recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures.
The ASL image dataset used to train models is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kapillondhe/american-sign-language).

## Approach
Because image classification involves vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) form the basis of our approach.

## Deep Learning Architectures Explored
- Custom CNN
- Residual Neural Network (ResNet)
- VGG16
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
